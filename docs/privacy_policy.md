# Privacy Policy
Last Modified: December 20, 2016

Trognon is a small app to help you to remind the food you bought before it reaches the expiration date.

We care about your privacy, so when you use this service you do not share any informations with us. However we use third-parties services and make use of your smartphone hardware to be able to create this service. So we want to be upfront about those points and explain how we use them and what are they doing.

That’s why we’ve written this Privacy Policy. And it’s why we’ve tried to write it in a way that’s blissfully free of the legalese that often clouds these documents. Of course, if you still have questions about anything in our Privacy Policy, just contact us.

## Information We Get
We do not collect any personal informations, the service doesn't need them. Moreover we do not implement some login mechanisms or other related mechanisms that could identify yourself. We also want to clarify two more points:
- Information we get when you use our service.
- Information we get from third parties.

### Information We Get When You Use Our Services
We use the smartphone camera in order to scan products barcode and only get barcode values when one of them is detected. We use the barcode API from google vision package that run locally on the device. We dot not use the camera to take pictures or stream content to other services, applications or servers. Moreover the camera is only alive when the application is up and you can shutdown it at any moment when using the application.

### Information We Collect from Third Parties
We may collect information that other services provide regarding barcode you scan. We only use one third-party service called Open Food Facts, an open source food products database, more info here: http://world.openfoodfacts.org/.

## How We Use Information
Barcode scanned are used to get detailed informations about prodcuts by requesting Open Food Facts service. The entire data is kept locally on your phone and remains private (list of products, barcodes...). We do not provide informations to other third-parties services or applications. Also we do not track you inside the app and ads are inexistent.

## How We Share Information with Third Parties
The only information we shared is the scanned barcode that we send through the Open Food Facts service. This service cannot reasonably be used by anyone else to identify you.

## How Long We Keep Your Data
We do not keep your content in any databases, servers or external services. Your data remains on your smartphone from the first second your use the service until you uninstalled the application. The data is swept out when the service is uninstalled from your smartphone.

## Control over Permissions
You can anytime revoking permissions of the application. The only permission asked is the camera, you are free to revoke it through the settings of your smartphone. If you do so, you may loose the main functionality of the application.

## Revisions to the Privacy Policy
We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. But when we do, we’ll let you know one way or another. Sometimes, we’ll let you know by revising the date at the top of the Privacy Policy that’s available on our website and mobile application. Other times, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our websites’ homepages or providing you with an in-app notification).

2016 Trognon.
